  <p>Hear me out.</p>
  <p>Today's racism isn't like it used to be.
  It used to be obvious to spot someone who was racist because they would be wearing a lame pointy white hat,
  or would foam at the mouth if you mention MLK or Malcolm X.</p>
  <p>Today's racism is different.
  Today's racism is unconscious.
  It exists in the back-of-the-mind.
  It's the "I'm not racist, but...", the "All Lives Matter",
  or the hesitation to condemn white cops who kill unarmed people of color.</p>
  <p>We are not racist because we act out in our racism.
  We are racist because we do not act out in response to racism.
  We are racist in our complacency.</p>
  <p>As white people, we are privileged in such a way that we can't understand and empathize with the struggles that people of color face on a regular basis. In the same way that the wealthy cannot speculate on what it's like to be homeless, the privileged white cannot understand what it's like to be an underprivileged person of color. Formally, this is known as our [implicit bias](http://www.onbeing.org/program/mahzarin-banaji-the-mind-is-a-difference-seeking-machine/8719).</p>
  <p>But the sooner we recognize this and come to terms with it,
  the sooner we can make efforts to combat this implicit bias.</p>
  <p>And once we begin making those efforts, these are some things we can do to help<p>
