## Objective

The purpose of this repository, and associated [website](http://thebrokendialogue.com)
are to help shed light on systemic racism that is common in America.
Specifically, the aim is directed at "white" people
who are so often the primary cause of racism.

Racism in the sense of this objective is directed at implicit bias.

In encouraging "white" people to recognize their implicit bias,
several helpful actions are also presented.

## Contribution

The repository is currently being hosted on AWS S3 with simple bucket-style, static-site delivery. To deliver code to production, submit a pull request to the master branch.

After the master branch is merged, the publisher (@bittelc) will push the new files to S3.

## Known ToDo's

1. Find the best link for racism on a "regular basis" in `white-person-pg4`
  * Perhaps Ta Nehisi-Coates
  * Or Maya Angelou
2. Make site ready for mobile viewers
  * Site currently optimized for only a 15' display
  * Must make pretty for mobile
  * Must make pretty for 13' (and tablets?)
3. Perhaps deliver some sort of better message than just a redirect if the person is not "white"
  * Unlikely
