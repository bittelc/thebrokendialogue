## Objective

The purpose of this repository, and associated [website](http://thebrokendialogue.com) are to help shed light on systemic racism that is common in America. Specifically, the aim is directed at "white" people who are so often the primary cause of racism.


## Known TODOs

1. Find the best link for racism on a "regular basis" in `white-person-pg4`
  * Perhaps Ta Nehisi-Coates
  * Or Maya Angelou
2. Make site ready for mobile viewers
  * Site currently optimized for only a 15' display
  * Must make pretty for mobile
  * Must make pretty for 13' (and tablets?)
