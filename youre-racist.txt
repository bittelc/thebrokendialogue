You're racist!

Yes. We're racist, and we must own up to that fact. You, me, all the white people you went to school with. We're all racist. And we must accept that.
You may be feeling defensive. You may be thinking, "I am going back to Facebook to find cat memes, because this is absurd", or "Of course I'm not racist! I have black friends and am not in the KKK", and finally the circular argument "I'm not racist because I treat everyone with respect".

Hear me out.

Today's racism isn't like that anymore. It's hard to spot. It's subtle. It's more like breadcrumbs, inevitably leading us to our racist roots.
Today's racism is unconscious. It exists in the back-of-the-mind. It's the "I'm not racist, but...", the "All Lives Matter", or the hesitation to condemn white cops who kill unarmed people of color. 

The truth is that, as white people, we are privileged in such a way that we can't understand and empathize with the struggles that people of color face on a regular basis. In the same way that the wealthy cannot speculate on what it's like to be homeless, the privileged white cannot understand what it's like to be an underprivileged person of color. Formally, this is known as our [implicit bias](http://www.onbeing.org/program/mahzarin-banaji-the-mind-is-a-difference-seeking-machine/8719)

But the sooner we recognize this and come to terms with it, the sooner we can make efforts to combat this implicit bias.

And once we begin making those efforts, these are some things we can do to help:

1. Accept that there is systemic racism in America
When 12% of the population is black, but 35% of the prison population is black, that is racism.
When 24% of the [black population lives in poverty](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/), as compared to 9% of white, that is racism.
When black-sounding names are [less likely to get the job](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-sounding-names-study_us_561697a5e4b0dbb8000d687f) than white-sounding names, that is racism.
When a police officer [shoot an unarmed black man](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/21/charles-kinsey-did-everything-right-the-police-still-shot-him.html?via=desktop&source=twitter%22%20target=), with his hands above his head, that is racism.
When that police officer goes [largely without punishment](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article91309192.html) that is racism.
There is a systemic problem with racism in America.

2. Work against your own implicit bias
Take [this survey](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) from Harvard. Assuming you did as poorly as I did, soak in the results. Absorb them and think about them. Simply by taking the test, I began to identify my own bias. And as a result, I walk down the street and I can more quickly correct 

3. Meet black people in black spaces
If you're like me, most of your conversations and interactions with PoC are in white spaces.
