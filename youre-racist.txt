You're racist!

Yes. We're racist, and we must own up to that fact. You, me, all the white people you went to school with. We're all racist. And we must accept that.
You may be feeling defensive. You may be thinking, "I am going back to Facebook to find cat memes, because this is absurd", or "Of course I'm not racist! I have black friends and am not in the KKK".

Hear me out.

Today's racism isn't like that anymore. It's hard to spot. It's subtle. It's more like breadcrumbs, inevitably leading us to our racist roots.
Today's racism is unconscious. It exists in the back-of-the-mind. It's the "I'm not racist, but...", the "All Lives Matter", or the self-worth you feel after treating a person of color with respect.

The truth is that, as white people, we are privileged in such a way that we can't understand and empathize with the struggles that people of color face on a regular basis. In the same way that the wealthy cannot speculate on what it's like to be homeless, the privileged white cannot understand what it's like to be an underprivileged person of color.

But the sooner we recognize this and come to terms with it, the sooner we can make efforts to combat this implicit bias.
