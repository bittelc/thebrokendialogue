You're racist!

Yes. We're racist, and we must own up to that fact. You, me, the white people you went to school with, the white people at the U2 concert. We're all racist. And we must accept that.

You may be feeling defensive. You are thinking, "I've got black friends", or "I don't use the N-word".

But that's no longer sufficient.

Hear me out.

Today's racism isn't like it used to be. It used to be obvious to spot someone who was racist because they would be wearing a lame pointy white hat, or would foam at the mouth if you mention MLK or Malcolm X.

Today's racism is different. Today's racism is unconscious. It exists in the back-of-the-mind. It's the "I'm not racist, but...", the "All Lives Matter", or the hesitation to condemn white cops who kill unarmed people of color.

We are not racist because we act out in our racism. We are racist because we do not act out in response to racism. We are racist in our complacency.

As white people, we are privileged in such a way that we can't understand and empathize with the struggles that people of color face on a regular basis. In the same way that the wealthy cannot speculate on what it's like to be homeless, the privileged white cannot understand what it's like to be an underprivileged person of color. Formally, this is known as our [implicit bias](http://www.onbeing.org/program/mahzarin-banaji-the-mind-is-a-difference-seeking-machine/8719).

But the sooner we recognize this and come to terms with it, the sooner we can make efforts to combat this implicit bias.

And once we begin making those efforts, these are some things we can do to help:

1. Accept that there is systemic racism in America
When 12% of the population is black, but 35% of the prison population is black, that is racism.
When 24% of the [black population lives in poverty](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/), as compared to 9% of white, that is racism.
When black-sounding names are [less likely to get the job](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-sounding-names-study_us_561697a5e4b0dbb8000d687f) than white-sounding names, that is racism.
When a police officer [shoots an unarmed black man](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/21/charles-kinsey-did-everything-right-the-police-still-shot-him.html?via=desktop&source=twitter%22%20target=), with his hands above his head, that is racism.
When that same police officer goes [largely unpunished](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article91309192.html) that is racism.

2. Work against your own implicit bias
Take [this survey](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) from Harvard. Assuming you did as poorly as I did, soak in the results. Absorb and think about them. Simply by taking the test, I began to identify my own bias. Walking down the street, it is now more obvious to me when my implicit bias is at work. When we understand what our implicit biases are whispering, we can silence them more quickly.

3. Meet black people in black spaces
If you're like me, most of your conversations and interactions with people of color are in white spaces, meaning most of the people around are white. But by limiting ourselves to having conversations with people of color in white spaces, we're hurting people of color in two ways.
First, many black people feel uncomfortable being themselves in white spaces. Meeting black people in black spaces allows us to listen and learn in a more organic way.
Secondly, by being the minority in the room, you can experience some of the discomfort that people of color feel in white spaces. Once we recognize this, we can identify the situation the next time that you meet someone of color in a white space.

4. Stop telling. Start listening.
When people of color start explaining to us about a racist incident, it makes us uncomfortable. It makes us scared to think that we have something in common with someone who is racist. We avoid this discomfort by deflecting the authenticity of the claim. We think "well there may be two sides to this story" and that way we don't have to think "this person experienced racism from someone who fits a very similar profile to myself".
When a conversation about racism begins, it is [our responsibility](http://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2015/fierce-humanism/the-part-about-black-lives-mattering-where-white-people-shut-up-and-listen) to give the oppressed the floor, and we take a peripheral roll.


5. Say Black Lives Matter
'nuff said.
If you still think "All Lives Matter", there are more than enough resources ((here)[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jesse-damiani/every-time-you-say-all-li_1_b_11004780.html]. (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmXwAMQ8P24]. (here)[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/us/all-lives-matter-black-lives-matter.html?_r=0]) illustrating why it's incorrect.

6. Talk to others
This is the hard one...
People of color are discredited when they discuss racism with many white people. This is obviously a Catch 22- how can you be open to accepting that you're racist or that there is systemic racism present if you're constantly discrediting the receiver of the racism.
And as such, many white people must begin to see that racism is a systemic problem by engaging in a conversation with other white people. (Of course, don't break rule #4, though).
