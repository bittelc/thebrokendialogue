      <p>As white people, we are privileged in such a way that we can't understand and empathize with the struggles that people of color face on a regular basis. In the same way that the wealthy cannot speculate on what it's like to be homeless, the privileged white cannot understand what it's like to be an underprivileged person of color. Formally, this is known as our [implicit bias](http://www.onbeing.org/program/mahzarin-banaji-the-mind-is-a-difference-seeking-machine/8719).</p>
      <p>But the sooner we recognize this and come to terms with it,
      the sooner we can make efforts to combat this implicit bias.</p>
      <p>And once we begin making those efforts, these are some things we can do to help<p>
