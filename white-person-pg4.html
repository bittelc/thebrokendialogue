      <p>As white people, we are privileged in such a way
      that we can't understand and empathize with the
      struggles that people of color face on
      a <a href=#>regular basis</a>.</p>
      <p>In the same way that the wealthy cannot speculate on
      what it's like to be homeless,
      the privileged white cannot understand what it's like to
      be an underprivileged person of color.</p>
      <p>Formally, this is known as our
        <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/mahzarin-banaji-the-mind-is-a-difference-seeking-machine/8719">implicit bias</a>.</p>
      <p>But the sooner we recognize this and come to terms with it,
      the sooner we can make efforts to combat this implicit bias.</p>
      <p>And once we begin making those efforts,
      these are some things we can do to <a href="what-we-can-do-pg1.html">help</a>.</p>
