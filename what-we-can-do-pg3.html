      <h2>3. Meet black people in black spaces</h2> 
      <p>If you're like me, most of your conversations and interactions with people of color are in
        <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article91309192.html">white spaces</a>,
        meaning most of the people around are white.</p>
      <p>But by limiting ourselves to having conversations with
        people of color in white spaces,
        we're hurting people of color in two ways.</p>
      <p>1. Many black people feel uncomfortable being themselves in white spaces.
        Meeting black people in black spaces allows us to listen and learn in a more organic way.</p>
      <p>2. By being the minority in the room,
        you can experience some of the discomfort that people of color feel
        in white spaces.
        Once we recognize this, we can identify the situation the
        next time that you meet someone of color in a white space.</p>
