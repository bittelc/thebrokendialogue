      <p> This is the hard one...</p>
      <p>People of color are discredited when they discuss racism with many white people.</p>
      <p>This is a Catch 22:
        how can you be open to accepting that you're racist
        or that there is systemic racism present
        if you're constantly discrediting the receiver of the racism.</p>
      <p>And as such, many white people must begin to see
        that racism is a systemic problem
        by engaging in a conversation
        with other white people.</p>
      <p>(Of course, don't break rule #4, though).</p>
